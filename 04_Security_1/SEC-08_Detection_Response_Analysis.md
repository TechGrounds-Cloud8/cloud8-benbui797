# SEC-08 Detection Response Analysis
So far, weâ€™ve mostly looked at the prevention of attacks. While you want to prevent as many attacks as possible, some attacks will slip through your prevention systems. The most common method of getting malicious software (malware) into a network is through social engineering.

When getting hit with an attack, there are usually three steps to follow: Detection, response, and analysis.

Detecting an (attempted) attack is the first step to stopping it and to preventing future attempts. Tools like Wireshark can help analyse a network to detect anomalies. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are also used for this purpose.

**Intrusion Detection System**  
These systems analyse and monitor the traffic on a network for signs that indicate attackers are using a known cyberthreat to infiltrate or steal data from your network. IDS systems compare the current network activity to a known threat database to detect several kinds of behaviors like security policy violations, malware, and port scanners.

The first thing to do in response to a detected attack is trying to contain the damage. Depending on the kind of attack, the way you do this might differ. After the attack is contained, you can try to figure out the root cause of the attack, so that you can stop it. Finally, you enter the recovery phase, where you try to get all systems back online and you take stock of the damage done.

It is vitally important to have a plan in place for how to respond when an attack happens.
In the analysis phase, you document what you learned and harden your systems so that such an attack cannot happen again. Sometimes this can be as simple as updating the OS on a server.

Response, and analysis are part of a disaster recovery plan. This plan is an important part of a bigger business continuity plan. When a disaster strikes and infrastructure goes offline, a business could be done for. There are many strategies when it comes to mitigating a disaster. From just having a cold backup, to a redundant site.
For these strategies it is always important to keep track of the following metrics: How much data is lost on incident (Recovery Point Objective; RPO), how long it takes to be back online (Recovery Time Objective; RTO), and cost.
