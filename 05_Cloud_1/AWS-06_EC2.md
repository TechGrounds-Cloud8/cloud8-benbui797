# AWS-05 EC2
EC2 stands for Elastic Cloud Compute. It is an AWS service to create VM's. It makes scaling up and down very easy.  
  
There are 4 different types of instances:
- **General Purpose Instances** An instance with balanced stats between computing, memory and networking resources. It fits different purposes, such as: application server, gaming server, backend server and small/medium database servers.
- **Compute Optimized Instances** These instances when there is a need for high computing power. These are also useful for app-, gaming- and webapp servers, but are ideal for situations that require high-performance and compute-intensive tasks.
- **Memory Optimized Instances** This type can deliver very large dataset workloads fast. Memory is a temporary storage area, data is stored and processes it before the computer can run it. The processing allows for pre-loading which enables the CPU to have direct access. These instances work best when huge amounts of data need to be preloaded before running the app.
- **Accelerated Optimized Instances** This type uses hardware accelerators, which boost the data processing. These instances are best for graphics applications and streaming.
- **Storage Optimized Instances** This type is best when you have a large dataset on local storage (Large file systems, data warehouses or online transaction systems). These instances are designed to deliver many inputs as fast as possible.
