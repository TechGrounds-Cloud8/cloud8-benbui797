# AWS-03 Advantages of the Cloud
AWS lists six advantages of cloud computing. These are basic characteristics of the cloud that make it attractive for companies to use. Important to note that it also is a marketing tool for AWS to introduce the cloud to new customers. As such, it is an important part of the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam.

The six advantages listed are:
- Trade Capital expense (CapEx) for variable expense (OpEx)
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
- Stop guessing capacity
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes

You should be able to explain all six points, as well as recognise synonyms

Rephrasing the 6 points in the intro:  

1. **Payment Model** The cloud payment model is flexible, you pay for what you use. You do not have to invest in a data center, servers, and other resources. 
2. **Economies at Scale** Cloud computing is about shared resources. Sharing the infrastructure cost with hundreds of thousands of other customers lowers the overall costs.
3. **Flexible Capacity** Having and managing your own servers usually means overcapacity or undercapacity. In the cloud, you can grow freely and it can scale along with your requirements.
4. **Increased Speed** The flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier to develop and deploy applications. You can test and utilize resources as you want in minutes. You can have a VM or server up and running within minutes. If you need more resources, you can just request them, no need to buy additional hardware.
5. **Fewer Operations** Having your own data centers and servers requires resources and staffing. Through the cloud, you don't need to worry about the operations and you can focus on your applications and customers.
6. **Global Reach** AWS has data centers all over the world. The AWS Cloud's global reach allows you to swiftly deploy apps to consumers anywhere. Customers can access your apps quickly. You can pick the ones near your clients to reduce the latency. In addition to that, you can access your infrastructure from anywhere where you have an internet connection.

Another synonymed version:
1. Less investment, pay for what you use.
2. Sharing resources with other customers means lower prices for everyone.
3. No hardware means you don't need to plan your resource requirements. You can scale them as you go.
4. No hardware means you can launch different machines and services whenever you need, they are online within minutes
5. The hardware is maintained by AWS, therefore you don't have any operations to worry about.
6. AWS is global, therefore it's easier to be well accessable from anywhere in the world, but for your clients as for yourself (your developers/engineers).
