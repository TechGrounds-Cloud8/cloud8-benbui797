## Daily Report
I finished the CDK Workshop tutorial.
## Challenges
- It's just a walkthrough a simple app, without much explanation. There are a lot of basic things (Constructs) that I would like to have a better understanding of before building my own app from scratch.
- I tried to find some YouTube videos, but most of them where just following the same workshop, except you have a voice guiding you through it.
## Solutions
- I've looked for some more resources, I will read a larger part of the documentation. 
- Possibly look for a course about CDK. 
- Maybe buy the CDK Book?
## Learnings
- Basic CDK knowlegde
