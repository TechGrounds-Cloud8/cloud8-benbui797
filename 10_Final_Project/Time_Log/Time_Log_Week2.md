## Daily Report
I finished the chapter about serverless on DCT for the SA certificate. I scored 86% on my first practise exam. For the project, I added a S3 bucket that uploads the User Data script.
## Challenges
- Not really any challenges, but just reading the documentation and looking for information.
## Solutions
- The documentation is becoming more clear and easier to interpret.
## Learnings
- N/A

## Daily Report
I got the WebServer to download the script from S3 and executes it when it is launched.
## Challenges
- Learning how to add bucket policy's to the right resources without using the console
- yum didn't work at first because the traffic on the ephemeral ports got blocked
- LatestAmazonLinux is not actually the latest Amazon Linux AMI... But V1
## Solutions
- I used the log files on the instance to find and deduct my error
## Learnings
- Now I understand why logs are useful :)
