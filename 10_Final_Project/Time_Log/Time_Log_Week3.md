## Daily Report
- Worked all day on my bash script that checks if a disk has a partition, if not, create it and mount it
## Challenges
- Lack of bash experience
## Solutions
- Google/StackOverflow
## Learnings
- Spend 6+ on this and have now enrolled in a udemy course about bash scripting that takes 6 hours... might have been more efficient.
