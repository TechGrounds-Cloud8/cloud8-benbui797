# AWS-13-1 Elastic Beanstalk
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a service that allows developers to relinquish the deployment, management and configuration of infrastructure in the cloud. Beanstalk manages this for you. 
You can simply upload your code, it will be analysed and from that, Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring. Elastic Beanstalk will also keep everything up to date by installing patches and updates.  
Once your App is up and running, you can still access your resources like you normally would. You have the option to make manual adjustments or let Elastic Beanstalk manage everything for you.  
  
The biggest advantage of using this service, is that developers don't need any experience or expertise in working with the cloud. They can focus all their attention on what they do best; developing code. Especially in smaller companies where there may not always be budget to hire more staff, this sounds like a great solution.  
  
Languages that are supported are: Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, Python, Go, and Docker.
  
Because it takes away the management of the infrastructure, this is an example of a Platform as a Service (PaaS).

## Alternative Services
Most cloud providers have a similar service to Beanstalk, such as Azure Web Apps and Google App Engine. Heroku is a platform that offers this service (but doesn't offer the complete cloud package that AWS provides).
  
That is one advantage that Beanstalk offers over Heroku, it is a tool that manages the corresponding AWS services for you, but you still have access to all the other services as well. It is fully integrated with the rest of the AWS environment.

### Overcome challenges
[Give a short description of your challanges you encountered, and how you solved them.]

### Results
In a different course, I have made a simple webapp and uploaded it to Heroku, which similar functionality to Elastic Beanstalk. So as a practical assignment, I wanted to see if I could upload it in AWS and get it to work.
