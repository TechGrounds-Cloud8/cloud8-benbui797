# Git & Markdown
Markdown is a Markup language (similar to HTML). They are plaintext files that contain information how it should be stylistically formatted. The files themselves are WYSIWYM. 

The difference with WYSIWYG is that you don't see the style until it is 'rendered' (for example on GitHub, or in the preview function of Visual Studio Code)
