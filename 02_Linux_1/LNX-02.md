# LNX-02 Files and directories
Getting familiar with Linux structure of files and directories.

### Overcome challanges
- I had some previous experience with bash commands.
- I cannot find a desktop/public/picture directory inside my home folder. I believe the installed container is a lightweight version that doesnt have these folders installed by default.

### Results
I have used the commands and inserted a screenshot below:
