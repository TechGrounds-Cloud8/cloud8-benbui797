# Linux Shortcuts

mijn top tip is tab! niet tobben met typen, maar tabben!

### General
- Tab (autocomplete)
- Double Tab (if unable to autocomplete, list all options)
- `clear` or CTRL+L (Clear terminal screen)
- `history` list history of commands
- `!<num>` type index of command in history
- `cd -` Go back to previous working directory
- `cd ~` Go directly to /home directory
- `cd /` Go directly to /root directory
- up/down arrows (move through history of commands) (CTRL+P & CTRL+N)
- CTRL+R (search through command history)
- CTRL+D (exit current shell session)
- CTRL+C (exit/quit)
- `<command> --help` get help for command
- `man <command>` manual for command, but can be in nicer format than help

### Moving cursor
- CTRL+A (move to beginning of line (Home))
- CTRL+E (move to end of line (End))
- ALT+B (move 1 word backwards)
- ALT+F (move 1 word forwards)  

### Cut/Paste
- CTRL+K (Cut from this point forwards)
- CTRL+U (Cut from this point backwards)
- CTRL+W (Cut word preceding cursor (or if cursor is on a word, every letter preceding cursor))
- ALT+BCKSPC (Cut word preceding cursor, stops at special characters instead of spaces)
- CTRL+Y (Paste most recent cut)

### Bonus
- `sudo !!` (repeat previous command with sudo)
- CTRL+X+E (Continue editting current shell line in text editor)
- ALT+. (paste previous succesful command argument)
